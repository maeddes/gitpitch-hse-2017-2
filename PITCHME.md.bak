# INTRO

+++

## Some facts

* First released in 2011
* Open Cloud Native Platform / Platform as a Service
* Fast and easy to build, test, deploy & scale apps
* Works with many languages or frameworks
* Available as open source, commercial distributions or hosted offerings

IaaS / PaaS Taxonomy

![Cloud Stack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/images/power-of-platform.png)

(Source: docs.cloudfoundry.org)

+++

## PaaS Concepts

* Anyone can deploy applications quickly and make them accessible for everybody
* In case of high requests, the platform can scale the app easily
* Focus is on application an it's logic - not the underyling infrastructure

+++

## Cloud Load Balancing

* BOSH creates and deploys virtual machines (VMs) on top of a physical computing infrastructure, and deploys and runs Cloud Foundry on top of this cloud. 
* The CF Cloud Controller runs the apps and other processes on the cloud’s VMs, balancing demand and managing app lifecycles.
* The router routes incoming traffic from the world to the VMs that are running the apps that the traffic demands

# Administration

+++

## Orgs

- The outer grouping boundary
- An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators can own and use. 
- All collaborators access an org with user accounts. 
- Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, applications, services availability, and custom domains.

+++

## Spaces

- The inner grouping boundary
- Every application and service is scoped to a space. 
- Each org contains at least one space. 
- A space provides users with access to a shared location for application development, deployment, and maintenance.
- Each space role applies only to a particular space.

+++

## User Accounts

- A user account represents an individual person within the context of a CF installation. 
- A user can have different roles in different spaces within an org, governing what level and type of access they have within that space.

+++

## Roles and Permissions

- A user can have one or more roles. 
- The combination of these roles defines the user’s overall permissions in the org and within specific spaces in that org.

+++

## Domains

* The term domain in this topic differs from its common use and is specific to Cloud Foundry. 
* The use of domain name, root domain, and subdomain refers to DNS records.
* Domains indicate to a developer that requests for any route created from the domain will be routed to Cloud Foundry.

+++

## Quotas

Default Quota Plan for an Org

* Memory Limit: 10240 MB
* Total Routes: 1000
* Total Services: 100
* Non-basic Services Allowed: True
* Trial DB Allowed: True

# CF CLI

+++?gist=afaae0cfafd7e2dcb4193b4d29b613e6

+++

## Targets

```bash
$ cf login -a https://api.example.com -u username@example.com
API endpoint: https://api.example.com

Password>
Authenticating...
OK

Select an org (or press enter to skip):
1. example-org
2. example-other-org

Org> 1
Targeted org example-org

Select a space (or press enter to skip):
1. development
2. staging
3. production
```

+++

## Login

- Upon successful login, the cf CLI saves a config.json file containing your API endpoint, org, space values, and access token. If you change these settings, the config.json file is updated accordingly.

- By default, config.json is located in your ~/.cf directory. The CF_HOME environment variable allows you to locate the config.json file wherever you like.

# Buildpacks

+++

- Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications
- Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artifacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services.
- When you push an application, Cloud Foundry automatically detects which buildpack is required and installs it in the container where the application needs to run.

![Liberty](img/cf_liberty.png)

+++

- It is possible to build own buildpacks
- It is possible to create "offline" buildpacks
- Very often a local CF deployment does not have full Internet access
- Offline buildpacks can solve this problem, but need manual steps

# Routes & Blue/Green Deployment

+++

- In order to reach an application in Cloud Foundry it requires a route to be defined
- A standard route will be applied when an application is defined
- A route consists of host+domain information, e.g. cf-simple-hello.local.pcfdev.io
- By default the app name will be taken as host information, this can fail however is the URL is already in use
- Random route mapping is supported here

+++

### Listing apps and URLs

```bash
mhs@R2-D2 ~> cf apps
Getting apps in org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de...
OK

name                 requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
cf-full-scs          stopped           0/1         512M     1G     cf-full-scs.cfapps.io
cf-numbers-service   stopped           0/1         512M     1G     cf-numbers-service-corollaceous-cnida.cfapps.io
cf-simple-hello      stopped           0/1         256M     1G     cf-simple-hello.cfapps.io
cf-test-abc          started           1/1         1G       1G     cf-test-abc.cfapps.io
cf-test-abc-2        started           1/1         1G       1G     cf-test-abc-2.cfapps.io
```
+++

### Listing routes

```bash
mhs@R2-D2 ~> cf routes
Getting routes for org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de ...

space             host                                    domain      port   path   type   apps                 service
MHS_Development   cf-simple-hello                         cfapps.io                        cf-simple-hello
MHS_Development   cf-numbers-service-corollaceous-cnida   cfapps.io                        cf-numbers-service
MHS_Development   cf-numbers                              cfapps.io
MHS_Development   cf-full-scs                             cfapps.io                        cf-full-scs
MHS_Development   cf-test-abc                             cfapps.io                        cf-test-abc
MHS_Development   cf-test-abc-2                           cfapps.io                        cf-test-abc-2
```

+++

### Routes with no apps

```bash
mhs@R2-D2 ~> cf check-route cf-numbers cfapps.io
Checking for route...
OK
Route cf-numbers.cfapps.io does exist
mhs@R2-D2 ~> curl cf-numbers.cfapps.io
404 Not Found: Requested route ('cf-numbers.cfapps.io') does not exist.
```

The Gorouter will return 404 when a route exists, but does not point to an app.

+++

### Mapping and unmapping routes

```bash
mhs@R2-D2 ~> cf unmap-route cf-numbers-service cfapps.io --hostname cf-numbers-service-corollaceous-cnida
Removing route cf-numbers-service-corollaceous-cnida.cfapps.io from app cf-numbers-service in org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de...
OK

mhs@R2-D2 ~> cf map-route cf-numbers-service cfapps.io --hostname cf-numbers
Creating route cf-numbers.cfapps.io for org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de...
OK
Route cf-numbers.cfapps.io already exists
Adding route cf-numbers.cfapps.io to app cf-numbers-service in org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de...
OK
```

+++

### Duplicate mapping

```bash
mhs@R2-D2 ~/g/c/demo> cf map-route cf-test-abc-2 cfapps.io --hostname cf-test-abc
Creating route cf-test-abc.cfapps.io for org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de...
OK
Route cf-test-abc.cfapps.io already exists
Adding route cf-test-abc.cfapps.io to app cf-test-abc-2 in org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de...
OK
mhs@R2-D2 ~/g/c/demo> cf routes
Getting routes for org NovaTec Development / space MHS_Development as mhs@novatec-gmbh.de ...

space             host                                    domain      port   path   type   apps                        service
MHS_Development   cf-test-abc                             cfapps.io                        cf-test-abc,cf-test-abc-2
```

In case of single hostname mappings to multiple apps the Gorouter will apply a round robin behaviour to balance between the routes.

###  Blue Green Deployment

![BlueGreen](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/images/blue-green/blue-green.png)

(Source: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html)

---

# Demo

---

### Lessons learned

- Concept of "Bring your own code"
- Orgs, Spaces, Users, Quotas
- App + Buildpack = Droplet
- App logging, env, scaling & access
- Services - Managed & User-provided

---

## Clear by now?

![sketch1](img/20170421_202906.jpg)

---

### Advantages

- Easy deployment - only code necessary
- Automatic setup of immutable artifact
- Automatic restart - resilience
- Aggregated logging
- Scaling & Load-Balancing
- Fault tolerance

---

### Exercises

- Build a sample app (or re-use existing one)
- implement a manifest.yml (or modify existing one)
- Deploy the application
- Use the CLI to
  - analyze the logs
  - ssh into your application's container
  - kill it :)
  - scale the instances up and down
  
---
  
### Exercises II

- Run a while loop against an HTTP endpoint of your app
- Observe the round robin access of your instances
- Observe the availability with single & multiple instances
- List the services from the marketplace
- Create a service
- Bind a service
- Use the service (not described!)

---
  
### Exercises - for the fast ones :)

- Read about Blue - Green Deployment
- https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html
- Do it!

# Note

### pcf dev users use cf suspend/resume for your VM
